12th project of the OpenClassrooms "Web app developer - JavaScript React" course, Sportsee is an application for monitoring your physical activity. For this project I'm using React, React-router and D3.js and the project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Getting Started with SportSee App

This project needs backend and frontend apps.

## Backend

clone this repo https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

### `npm install`

to install the backend

### `npm start`

to run the backend. Message 'magic happens on port 3000' indicates the backend has successfully started on port 3000

## Frontend

clone this repo https://github.com/The-algar/Clermontet_Eric_P12_30102022

### `npm install`

to install the frontend

### `npm start`

to run the frontend. A message will warn you that port 3000 is already in use and asks if you want to use another one. Then type the key 'y' to accept. A browser window then opens so that you can access the app

## JS Doc

Documentation by JSDoc is available from the jsdoc directory. Launch your Live server and select the jsdoc directory to vizualize the code documentation or go to https://the-algar.github.io/Clermontet_Eric_P12_30102022/jsdoc/.

## MOCK / API Configuration switch

A boolean switch is displayed on the home page. If you select one of the 2 users with the "Mock" default state ON, mocked data is chosen, if you switch the button to API, API data is chosen. In both scenarios you will be led to the dashboard page accordingly.
